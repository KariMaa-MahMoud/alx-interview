The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. Write a program that solves the N queens problem.

Usage: nqueens N
If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments, print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
The program should print every possible solution to the problem
One solution per line
Format: see example
You don’t have to print the solutions in a specific order
You are only allowed to import the sys module

The N queens puzzle is a challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an NxN chessboard.

On a chessboard, the queen can move any number of squares vertically, horizontally
or diagonally.Thus, to solve the puzzle, each queen must be placed on its own
row, column and diagonal.

This is most efficiently solved using a backtracking algorithm. Backtracking is
a general algorithm for finding solutions to some computational problems that
incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate i.e.,
backtracks as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed
to a valid solution.

## Usage

`nqueens N`
where N is the number of queens. - N must be an integer greater or equal to 4 - the program prints every possible solution to the problem in the format
shown below

```
$ ./0-nqueens 4
[[0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 0], [3, 2]]
[[0, 2], [1, 0], [2, 3], [3, 1]]
```

Each inner list represents the coordinates of a queen in the NxN chessboard.
